This is a set of games I wrote in two days in Year 8 for an ICT lesson. About 2-3 hours total time.

It was a simple project to begin learning GUI in python, and I chose TKinter.

This code is bug-riddled and, in some places, unimplimented. It will not be fixed.

If you wish to run this, you will need to run start.py in a way your OS allows.

###Instructions:
You will be met by a large rectangle and two lines after hitting start. Use the 'a' key to keep the rectangle between the lines. You will have to do this for five seconds between every mini-game.
* Run mini-game:

    You are the black circle. Use WASD to move arround. Red circles will begin to spawn and chase you with OP ai. Your only advantage is that you may move around the edges of the screen - use this to your advantage and survive as long as possible.
* Jwalk mini-game:

    You control one black circle at a time. Use WASD to move around. You must dodge the 'cars' [rectangles] and make it to the other side. When you die or make it to the other side, you will switch controll to the next circle. Get as many across alive as possible.
    
* Zerg Rush mini-game:

    You must use your mouse to kill the advancing circles. They will go towards the middle rectange, which has health. The circles will hit the rectangle for 2 damadge when they are toutching it. Survive for as long as possible.
    
* Chain Reaction mini-game:

    You control the black rectangle [cannon]. Press 'w' to fire a shot. You must hit the larger circles - the smaller ones are debris. When you hit a larger circle, it will explode into 8 smaller ones. If these colide with the larger circles, they will also explode. Destroy the biggest number of circles.
    
* Cheats / Dev Commands:

    'reset' - starts the game over for use in crashes ;)
    
    'stop' - pauses the game's update clock
    
    'go' - resumes the game's update clock
    
    'ammo' - gives you almost infinite ammo on Chain Reaction
    
    'laser' - gives you infinite ammo and a cheat weapon on Chain Reaction
    
    'hp' - gives you almost infinite health on Zerg Rush
    
    'cross' - makes all of the people cross on Jwalk
    
    'bus' / 'run' / 'jwalk' / 'zergrush' / 'chainreaction' - skips to that minigame
